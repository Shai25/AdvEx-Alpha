## Test Steps

1. Set up AWS credentials in `~/.aws/config`.
2. Set up `PG_HOST`, `PG_USERNAME`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `PG_DATABASE` in environment variables.
3. Run `python db.py init` once.
4. Run `python db.py test` to see that the feedback for #1 submission is empty.
5. Start mock worker with `python worker.py`.
6. Send message with `python web_server.py`.
7. Run `python db.py test` again to see that the feedback has been updated. Also you should be able to observe that model and index files are downloaded to `tmp/`.
